## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Individual component testing
- Function-level tests
- Mocked dependencies
- Quick execution

### Integration Tests
- Component interaction testing
- API endpoint testing
- Database integration
- Service communication

### End-to-End Tests
- User flow testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing
- Performance testing

## Testing Tools

### Backend Testing
- clojure.test for unit tests
- test.check for property testing
- ring-mock for HTTP testing
- test.jdbc for database testing

### Frontend Testing
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library
- Cypress for E2E tests
- MSW for API mocking

### Mobile Testing
- Jest for React Native
- Detox for E2E testing
- Device farm testing
- Platform-specific tests

## Test Coverage

### Coverage Goals
- Backend: 90%+ coverage
- Frontend: 85%+ coverage
- Critical paths: 100%
- API endpoints: 100%

### Coverage Monitoring
- Regular coverage reports
- CI/CD integration
- Coverage trends
- Hot spot analysis

## Testing Environments
