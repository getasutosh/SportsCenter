- Good performance for read-heavy operations
- Native support for geospatial queries
- Suitable for rapid prototyping and iteration

### 3. Redis (Cache & Real-time Features)
**Purpose**: Caching, real-time features, and temporary data storage

**Used For**:
- Session management
- Real-time notifications
- Leaderboards and rankings
- Rate limiting
- Cache for frequently accessed data
- Temporary storage for video processing status
- Real-time chat features
- Websocket session management

**Why Redis**:
- Ultra-fast in-memory operations
- Built-in data structures (lists, sets, sorted sets)
- Pub/sub capabilities for real-time features
- Automatic key expiration
- Cluster mode for scaling
- Low latency requirements

### 4. Elasticsearch (Search & Analytics)
**Purpose**: Full-text search and analytics

**Used For**:
- Coach and program search
- Training video search
- Performance metrics analytics
- User activity logs
- Content search across training materials
- Analytics dashboards

**Why Elasticsearch**:
- Powerful full-text search capabilities
- Advanced analytics and aggregations
- Near real-time search
- Scalable for large datasets
- Good for time-series data
- Rich querying capabilities

### 5. Neo4j (Graph Database)
**Purpose**: Relationship-heavy features and recommendations

**Used For**:
- Coach-Athlete matching
- Training program recommendations
- Skill progression paths
- Social connections and mentorship
- Performance correlation analysis
- Training pattern analysis

**Why Neo4j**:
- Native graph data model
- Efficient for relationship queries
- Good for recommendation engines
- Cypher query language
- Visual relationship analysis
- Pattern matching capabilities

### 6. InfluxDB (Time Series Database)
**Purpose**: Time-series metrics and performance data

**Used For**:
- Athletic performance metrics
- Training session metrics
- System monitoring
- User engagement analytics
- Sensor data from wearables
- Progress tracking over time

**Why InfluxDB**:
- Optimized for time-series data
- High write performance
- Built-in data retention policies
- Efficient data compression
- Good for metrics and monitoring
- SQL-like query language

## Data Flow and Synchronization

### Real-time Data Flow
1. **Primary Transactions**:
   - PostgreSQL for initial storage
   - Redis for caching and real-time access
   - MongoDB for dynamic content

2. **Search Updates**:
   - PostgreSQL â†’ Elasticsearch through change data capture
   - Automated indexing pipeline

3. **Analytics Pipeline**:
   - InfluxDB for raw metrics
   - Elasticsearch for aggregated analytics
   - Redis for real-time dashboards

### Backup and Recovery Strategy

1. **Critical Data** (PostgreSQL):
   - Continuous WAL archiving
   - Daily full backups
   - Point-in-time recovery capability

2. **Document Store** (MongoDB):
   - Daily backups
   - Replica sets for redundancy
   - Oplog for point-in-time recovery

3. **Cache Layer** (Redis):
   - Redis persistence (RDB + AOF)
   - Regular RDB snapshots
   - Cluster replication

4. **Search & Analytics** (Elasticsearch):
   - Regular snapshots
   - Cross-cluster replication
   - Index lifecycle management

## Scaling Strategy

### Vertical Scaling
- PostgreSQL: Up to 64 CPU cores, 256GB RAM
- MongoDB: Up to 32 CPU cores, 128GB RAM
- Redis: Up to 16 CPU cores, 64GB RAM

### Horizontal Scaling
1. **PostgreSQL**:
   - Read replicas for read scaling
   - Partitioning for large tables
   - Connection pooling with PgBouncer

2. **MongoDB**:
   - Sharding for large collections
   - Replica sets for read scaling
   - Zone sharding for geo-distribution

3. **Redis**:
   - Redis Cluster for data partitioning
   - Redis Sentinel for high availability
   - Read replicas for read scaling

4. **Elasticsearch**:
   - Multiple nodes in cluster
   - Shard allocation
   - Cross-cluster replication

## Data Retention and Archival

### Hot Data
- Recent training sessions (30 days)
- Active user profiles
- Current performance metrics
- Ongoing programs

### Warm Data
- Training history (1 year)
- Performance trends
- Payment history
- Completed programs

### Cold Data
- Archived training sessions
- Historical metrics
- Completed programs
- Old payment records

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - At-rest encryption for all databases
   - TLS for in-transit encryption
   - Encrypted backups

2. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Database-level authentication
   - Audit logging
   - Network isolation

3. **Compliance**:
